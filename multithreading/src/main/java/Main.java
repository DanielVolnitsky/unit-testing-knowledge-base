/**
 * You may want to build a website that collects and summarizes social-media
 * sentiment on a given topic to your French users.
 * To do so, you could use the Facebook or Twitter API to find trending comments
 * about that topic in many languages and rank the most relevant ones with your internal algorithms.
 * Then you might use Google Translate to translate the comments into French or use Google Maps
 * to geolocate their authors, aggregate all this information, and display it on your website.
 * <p>
 * If any of these external network services are slow to respond,
 * of course, youâ€™ll want to provide partial results to your users,
 * perhaps showing your text results alongside a generic map with a question mark
 * in it instead of showing a blank screen until the map server responds or times out.
